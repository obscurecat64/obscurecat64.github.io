Happy new year! I've been wanting to start a simple blog to write about my tech learnings and life, so here it is!

For this blog, I used the official blog starter [Gatsby Starter Blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog).
It looks rather plain now but I hope to add more personality to it in time :)

I also hope to write about a lot more interesting things in the future so stay tuned!

Fun fact: the name "Wai Thoughts" is very much inspired by [Creed Thoughts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e5td7-Bpvc&ab_channel=JoshuaSteubing) from The Office. If you haven't watched The Office I highly recommend it!
