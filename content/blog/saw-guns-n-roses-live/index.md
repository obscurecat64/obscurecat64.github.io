I went to the Guns N' Roses Concert at the National Stadium! It was my first ever concert and I really enjoyed myself :smile:! I was initially really nervous as it was my first time going to a concert (much less alone) and I didn't know if there were any "concert etiquette". I was actually there really early and I could have gotten a better view if I had moved in before the other concert goers started streaming in! I didn't know what I was thinking, but I guess it also had to do with me feeling a bit self-conscious going alone when everyone had someone else :joy:. I still have to work on not caring so much about what others think of me moving forward!

But when the lights went off and the show started, I forgot all of that and I had fun! I've watched them perform on Youtube and definitely Axl sounded way better back then but I guess it's a side effect of growing older. He still runs from one end to the other just like before though! I also love his facial expressions when he performs and it's so cool to see him perform live :innocent:! And there's Slash too rocking the guitar! I know there are others too but too it's Axl and Slash I came to see!

One thing I was thinking about after was whether I should have recorded more of the performance. On one hand I wanted to have videos to capture the experience I had on that day, but on the other hand I wanted to enjoy the moment! I only took a couple of short videos, but most of them turned out not that great :sweat_smile:. So after some thought I think it's best to just enjoy the performance without having your phone out recording. Also, there'll be others (whom I appreciate!) who will record and upload it onto Youtube for free and they do a much better job than I do :joy:! So I'll just stick to watching those next time :smile:. Having said that I contributed and posted 2 videos (only the nicer ones) onto Tiktok, see if you can find them (if you're interested) :stuck_out_tongue:!

All in all, concert going is really fun but it's also quite expensive :sweat_smile:. Still, I'm looking forward to my next concert! Right now I'm considering the RHCP concert next year but I'll see how things go! I'm just going to leave some photos and gifs below now; thanks for stopping by!
